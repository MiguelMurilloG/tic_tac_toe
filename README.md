# Portfolio Project 3 - Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game implemented in Python. The objective is to be the first to align three of your marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal on a customizable n x n board. The game runs in a terminal and provides an interactive and engaging way for players to compete against each other or the computer. With clear instructions, robust input validation, and a replay option, this game offers a fun and challenging experience for all players.
